Greetings, Reader.
I am The Author, though that means little to those without context. To some, that may be but a title; to others, something to be feared; to others still, something to behold. Unorthodox perhaps, but when is being normal any fun? You write your own story, the pen is mightier than the sword, after all.‚Äç
To the point. You are about to read a story about 6 kids. Three from a world much like our own; three from a world very much alien. They will fight an unwinnable fight. They will kick, scream, and drag themselves through Hell. And maybe, just maybe, they might see the light at the end of a very long, very dark tunnel.
I hope you enjoy the show. See you soon.
-AH
